# North Carolina Election Shapefile
This shapefile was obtained from the North Carolina General Assembly’s website and processed by members of the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group (MGGG). 

## Sources
North Carolina election data and shapefiles come from the [North Carolina General Assembly’s 2016 Redistricting Reference Data](https://www.ncleg.gov/RnR/Redistricting/BaseData2016). Demographic data come from the [National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS)](https://www.nhgis.org).

## Processing
Demographic data was aggregated from the census block level to VTDs using the General Assembly’s Block Level Key. [Roundoff](https://github.com/gerrymandr/Preprocessing) was used to assign districts from the 2011 enacted plan, 2016 enacted plan, and the judge’s plan to VTDs.
